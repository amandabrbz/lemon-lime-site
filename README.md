# New Studie: Professional Site

This is the final project from [Front End Design Essencial's](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-essencial/) course.

I'll be using this repository for studies, simulations, getting my code cleaner and development better, and practicing points from my feedback process.

I'll be using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) as standard.
